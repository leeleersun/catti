1.气候变化已不是单纯的环境保护问题，而成为人类生存与发 展问题。中国需要改变以煤为主的能源结构和高污染、高能耗的 产业结构，以治理环境和应对全球气候变化。同时，积极应对气 候变化也是中国参与全球治理的责任，也是实现可持续发展的迫 切需要。中国作为世界最大的发展中国家，需要积极推动经济与能源的转型，以推动全球可持续发展。

Climate change is no longer an environmental problem; it is now a matter that affects human existence and development. China needs to upgrade its coal-centered energy mix and highly polluting and energy-intensive industrial structure, as it strives to clean up the environment and respond to global climate change. At the same time, combating climate change is China's responsibility in global governance and meets the urgent need for sustainable development as well. As the world's largest developing country, China needs to promote economic transformation and upgrade the energy mix, so as to facilitate sustainable development worldwide.

2.长期以来，中国高度重视气候变化问题，把积极应对气候变化作为国家经济社 会发展的重大战略，把绿色低碳发展作为生态文明建设的重要内容，采取了一系 列行动，为应对全球气候变化做出了重要贡献。到 2020 年单位国内生产总值二氧 化碳排放比 2005 年下降 40%-45%，非化石能源占一次能源消费总量的比重达到 15%, 森林面积比 2005 年增加 4000 万公顷，森林蓄积量比 2005 年增加 13 亿立 方米。

For a long time, the country has attached great importance to the issue of climate change.  It has mainstreamed climate measures into national economic and social development strategies, and green and low-carbon development into environmental protection efforts. Also, it has adopted a series of measures which significantly contribute to global climate actions. The country has pledged that compared to 2005 levels, it will **reduce** carbon dioxide intensity of the economy **by** 40%-45%, **increase** the proportion of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption **to** 15%, **expand** forest converage **by**  40 million hectares, and **increase** forest growing stock volume **by** 1.3 billion cubic meters by 2020.

3.中国还将在农业、林业、水资源等重点领域和城市、沿海、生态脆弱地区形成 有效抵御气候变化风险的机制，提高抵抗能力。

In primary sectors - including agriculture, forestry and water resources - and in cities, **coastal reigons** and ecologically fragile regions, China will build effective mechanism that help strengthen local climate resilience.
