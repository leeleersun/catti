1，水稻是世界上最主要的粮食作物之一，世界上一半人口（包 括中国 60% 以上人口）都以稻米为主食。中国是世界上最早种 植水稻的国家，至今已有 7000 年左右的历史，当前水稻产量占 全国粮食作物产量近一半。

As one of the major food crops in the world, rice feeds 50% of the global population, including 60% of the Chinese population. China is the earliest rice-planting country - it began to grow rice more than 7000 years ago, and today rice accounts for about 50% of its food production.

2,水稻作为最主要的粮食作物，无论对 中国还是世界的重要性都不言而喻，关键在袁隆平，中国杂交水 稻之父，他的名字不仅在中国**家喻户晓**，也在世界上享有盛誉。

Rice, the world's most important food crop, is important to both China and the wider world. But the key figure behind rice production is Yuan Longping， who is widely known as "the father of hybrid rice". He is not only a **household** **name** in China, but also enjoys an internatioal reputation.

3, 袁隆平从上世纪六十年代开始研究杂交水稻，他带领科研团队使中国的杂交水 稻一直领先于世界水平，不仅不断实现了杂交水稻的高产量目标，而且在生产实践 中不断推广应用，从实际上解决了中国人**吃饭难**的问题。

Yuan started hybrid rice research in the 1960s, and the research team led by him has turned China into a world leader in this section. They have not only achieved high yields but also extended their technology across China, thus fundamentally addressing **food shortage** in the country.

4,袁隆平多次去美国，印度 等国家传授技术，为 30 多个国家和地区的政府官员和科研工作者讲学，促进杂交 水稻的技术发展，造福世界。

In addition, Yuan shared his expertise in the United States, India and many other countries and gave lectures to goverment officials and scientific researchers in more 30 countries and regions. In doing so, he has promoted hybrid rice technology and delivered benefits to the world.

5,1987 年 11 月 3 日，联合国教科文组织在巴黎总部向袁隆平颁发了科学奖，认 为他的成果是“第二次绿色革命”。2004 年，袁隆平获得世界粮食奖，为了表彰 他为人类提供营养丰富的和数量多的粮食而作出的突出贡献。

In November 3, 1987, UNESCO presented the Science Prize to Yuan Longping at its Paris headquarters, citing his research achievements as the "Second Green revoluton". And in 2004, he recieved the World Food Prize **in recogonition of** his significant contributions to providing **nutrious and sufficent food** for humanity.
