1，2020年11月中国开始了第七次人口普查。人口普查将为开启全面建设社会主义现代化国家新征程提供科学准确的统计信息支持。

China launched its seventh national census in November 2020, **and the output is expected to** provide **a relevant and accurate snapshot of its population** and inform the nation's  efforts in building a modern socialist country in all respects.

2,人口普查是推动经济高质量发展的内在需求。当前，我国经济正处于转变发展方式，优化经济结构，转换增长动力的攻关期。

The latest census is an inherent requirement of high-quality economic development. The Chinese economy is now **at a significant stage** of transforming the growth model, enhancing economic restructruing and transforming to new growth drivers.

3，及时查清人口数量、结构和分布这一基本国情，摸清人力资源结构信息，才能够更加准确地把握需求结构、城乡结构、区域结构、产业结构等状况，为推动经济高质 量发展，建设现代化经济体系提供有力的支持。

**In this context,** accurate and up-to-date data about the size, strcuture and distrubution of the population, as well as  the demographic makeup of the labor force, can **yield a deeper insight into** the demand structure, rural-urban imbalances, regional disparities, and the industrial strcuture, and at the same time **inject strong momentum into** a high-quality development path and a modern economic system.

4,人口普查是完善人口发展战略和政策体系，促进人口长期均衡发展的迫切需要。 自 2010 年第六次全国人口普查以来，我国人口发展的内在动力和外部条件发生了 显著改变 。人口总规模增长减缓，劳动年龄人口波动下降，老龄化程度不断加深。

The 2020 census is also an urgent neccesity in the push to modernize China's strategy and policy system on population development and to achieve the long-term, balanced development of population. Since the sixth census in 2010, there have been dramatic changes in the internal dynamics and external conditions of  population development in our country, including slowing population growth, a declining working-age population, and a rapid aging.

5,全面查清我国人口数量、结构、分布、城乡住房等方面的最新情况，了解人口增长、 劳动力供给、流动人口变化情况，摸清老年人口规模，为制定和完善未来收入、消费、 教育、就业、养老、医疗、社会保障等政策措施提供基础，也为教育和医疗机构布局、 儿童和老人服务设施建设、工商业服务网点分布、城乡道路建设等提供依据。

However, the cencus can help gather the latest data about the size, in labor supply and in migration, and calculate the size of the elderly population. These data lay the foundations for formulating and improving policy measures in terms of  income, consumption, education, employment, health care, senior care and social protection. Also, they provide meaningful input to the planning for educational and medical institutions, the construction of facilities for children and senior citizens, the geographical distributions of service outlets of businesses and the development of road infrastructure in both rural and urban areas.

6,人口普查工作从方案制定、物资准备、试点、人员培训、入户登记到数据处理 等一切工作都离不开人，队伍建设非常重要。能否组织好人口普查队伍，能否做好 普查人员的选调，直接影响到普查的工作质量和数据质量。

Capacity-building of census workers is critical, because they are active throughout the process, from plan-making to preparation of materials, from trial programs to personnel training, from door-to-door visits to data-processing. Ultimately, the effectiveness and efficiency of census operations and quality of data depend on **efforts** to select and hire qualified workers and then build a strong census team.
