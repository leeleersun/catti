1，互联网在中国改革开放过程中起到的巨大作用怎么说都不为过。从 2000 年开始， 中国互联网应用的普及， 现在已经快 20 年了。尤其是在最后 15 年里，互联网为中国的高速发展起到了 决定性的作用。

The significance of the internet to China's reform and opening up cannot be overemphasized. In the past two decades since 2000, the internet gained in popularity in China. Particularly, it has played a decisive role in China's rapid development in the past 15 years.

2, 经济要发展，有两点是至关重要的：第一是提高 生产效率，提高生产质量，搞更有创意的设计；第二是确保渠道 的畅通，让工厂生产的东西以最快的速度、最低的成本到消费者的手里。

Economic development requires efforts on two fronts. First, we need to improve the efficiency and the quality of production and boost creativity in design; second, we need to ensure  unimpeded distribution channels that allow factory goods to reach the market at the fastest rate and at the lowest cost.

3, 互联网在两个环节都为中国的产业发展起到了推动的作用。互联网的发展极大 地缩小了我们与先进国家在设计理念和设计人才的差距。通过互联网，我们以更快 的速度获取全球最先进的设计技术和理念。

The internet has been a driving force behind these efforts, thus facilitating China's industrial development. In addition, the development of internet has siginificantly **bridged our gap** with developed countries in terms of developing design philosophy and training design professionals. With the help of the Internet, we can now **gain quicker access to state-of-the-art** technology and philosophy.

4,在渠道的领域，它的效果更加明显，比如说电商。老百姓通过互联网更容易表 达自己的意愿，更容易对我们现有的一些产品提出批评性的意见，而这些也都更好 地推动企业的生产，推动政府职能转变。

The role of the internet is more visible in distribution channels, and a telling example is e-commerce. On the Internet, the general public find it much easier to express their opinions and make critical commens on products, which contributes to industrial prodution and goverment transformation.

5,互联网在获取信息、信息沟通上，把农村 人和城市人放在了平等的地位上。通过互联网，每一个人都能够实时地看到国家的 进步和城市的高速发展。反过来，这极大激发了人们谋求发展的愿望，而这些愿望 又转化成巨大的动力，更好的促进发展。

Meanwhile, rural and urban residents are placed on an equal footing in terms of  accessing and sharing informaion, and on the Internet every citizen can see national progress and rapid urban development in real time. This in turn kindles the public‘s aspirations for greater prosperity, and these aspirations translate into strong driving forces for development.
