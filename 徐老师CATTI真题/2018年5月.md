1.煤炭是地球上储量最丰富的能源，但反对使用煤炭的声浪日 益高涨。煤炭巨大的碳排放量引起气候变化，从而引起公众的 担忧。煤炭与其它类型燃料相比，竞争力下降。以美国为例， 页岩气的出现造成部分出煤量因价格过高而被挤出市场。美国 去年煤炭需求接近 9.2 亿吨，由于天然气价格下降，今年煤炭需求将减少 6000 万到 8000 万吨。

Coal is the most abundant energy source in the world, but there is a growing voice against coal consumption. The fact that the enormous of carbon emissions from burning coals leads to climate change has aroused public concern. In fact, coal is less competitive compared with other sources of energy. For example, in the United States the advent of shale gas has squeezed some coal outputs out of market **due to their high prices.** Last year, American coal demand was close to 920 million tons, and **as a result of falling natural gas prices**, will drop by 60 million to 80 million tons this year.

2.数据显示，煤炭满足了全球大约 30% 的能源需求，提供了 40% 以上的电力。 在人口第一和第二大国的中国和印度，煤炭所满足的能源需求比例甚至高达 70% 左 右。中国的煤炭消费量在去年已经下降，煤炭进口下滑了 11%。这是十年来的首次 下滑。中国的经济增长速度已经放缓，同时也做出极大努力消减煤炭使用以减少煤 炭污染。由于燃煤发电厂没有满负荷运行，再加上煤炭供应充足，造成国际煤炭价 格压低，煤炭出口价格从去年的峰值下跌了约 60%。

Statistics reveal that globally, coal meets about 30 percent of energy needs and generates 40 percent of electricity. In China and India, the world's two most  populous countries, coals meets up to 70 precent of energy demand. Last year Chinese coal consumption declined and its coal import, for the first time in a decade, dropped by 11 percent. In the context of an economic slowdown, China makes extraordinary efforts to reduce coal consumption and attendant pollution. **Since** coal-fired power plants are not operating at full capacity and supply is sufficent, coal prices are falling on the international market: export prices have fallen by about 60 percent from their peak last year.
